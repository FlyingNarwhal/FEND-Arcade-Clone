===============================

Students should use this rubric: https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud015/l-3072058665/m-3072588797

for self-checking their submission.

TO RUN:
open index.html in a browser

TO Play:
Use arrow keys to move your character to the water. Watch out though,
if you hit a bug, you'll be reset to the beginning.

Well, the same thing happens when you get to the water too, but
you won't feel gross after.
