This project uses the HTML5 game canvas, and psuedo-classical JavaScript design patterns.
For a live preview of this project, [click here](https://FlyingNarwhal.github.io/arcadeClones).

TO RUN:
open live preview

TO Play:
Use arrow keys to move your character to the water. Watch out though,
if you hit a bug, you'll be reset to the beginning.

Well, the same thing happens when you get to the water too, but
you won't feel gross after.
